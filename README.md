# AlphaKnit 🧶 — v6.6-F "The Blind Discovery"

AlphaKnit is a research-grade Constructive Structural AI that translates 3D point clouds into valid, compilable knitting and amigurumi patterns. 

This version (**v6.6-F**) introduces the **Blind Discovery Engine**, a scientific framework for verifying topological emergence through causal falsification, hidden probes, and state-aware observers.

## 🚀 Key Features (v6.6-F)

- **Causal Intervention Engine**: Injects topological noise or rank-clipping to verify structural causality.
- **Hypothesis Falsification**: Automates the "Discovery" process by verifying the persistence of motifs across epochs.
- **Null Emergence Suite**: Implements placebo-controlled training (Random Labels/Noise) to ensure genuine geometric learning.
- **Observer Purity (Passive Bias)**: Decouples measurement from optimization using rotating probe pools.
- **Topology Tension Field (TTF)**: A pseudo-physics loss that encourages structural organization without direct supervision.

## 🛠️ Usage (Local Windows PC)

AlphaKnit v6.6-F is optimized for standalone execution on local workstations.

### 1. Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.10+ and an NVIDIA GPU.
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/KiettranFNF002/AlphaKnit-Topology.git
cd AlphaKnit-Topology
```

### 2. NASA-Style Launch
Use the automated launcher for environment setup, dataset generation, and state-aware training:
```cmd
.\run_pc.bat
```
The system will automatically detect your latest checkpoint and transition through:
1. **PHASE 1 (Grammar Warmup)**: Stabilizing entropy.
2. **PHASE 2 (Airlock)**: Selective Optimizer Reset & Physics Induction.
3. **PHASE 3 (Mastery)**: Hypothesis testing and crystallization.

## 🔬 Scientific Telemetry

View research diagnostics and structural metrics:
```bash
python scripts/plot_v6_telemetry.py --history checkpoints/training_history_v6.6F.json
```
This tracks **Phase Lag**, **Rank Stability**, and **Causal Confidence** in real-time.
